# Fractal starterkit

Reusable [Fractal](http://fractal.build/) starterkit with basic component examples. Uses the same `gulpfile.js` as provided in the [official documentation](http://fractal.build/guide/integration/build-tools) with small additions.
It comes with a task to publish the exported styleguide on Github Pages too.

Use it as a starterkit or for a real life example.

## Installation and usage

- run `npm install`.
- `gulp fractal:start` start the Fractal server.
- `gulp fractal:build` run a static export of the project web UI.
- `gulp build` deploy production styleguide on a gh-pages branch.
